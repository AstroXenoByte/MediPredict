# Medipredict: Multi-Disease Prediction Web Application

## Overview
Medipredict is a web-based application designed to provide **scientific predictions** for multiple health conditions using machine learning models.  
The goal is to offer accessible preliminary screening tools for users who may lack easy access to clinical diagnostics.

## Current Features
- **Breast Cancer Prediction:** Diagnoses likelihood of malignancy based on clinical data inputs.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Uses user input on health indicators and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking) to predict diabetes risk.
- **Eye Disease Detection:** Analyzes eye images to identify common ocular conditions.

Each prediction model has its dedicated subpage accessible from the main website.

- It does **not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment**.
- Users should consult healthcare professionals for accurate diagnosis and care.
